# This can be left empty or used to facilitate imports from subpackages

# For instance, if you wanted to expose a high-level function directly from this level, you could:
# from .shopify_api.client import setup_shopify_session
# from .forecasting.prophet_model import run_prophet_forecast

# However, typically, __init__.py files can be left empty in modern Python projects for simplicity
